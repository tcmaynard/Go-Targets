# Go-Targets
Archive of my personal PowerShell Go module target directories/shortcuts

I use the Go module pretty heavily to jump around on my system(s).  I also 
tend to FORMAT C: (or experience a similar disaster) and lose all of my
go targets.

Keeping them safe and sound (and reasonably current) here is just a comfort,
not a necessity.

Usage:
  1. Clone into ~/AppData/local/go
  2. Done!
